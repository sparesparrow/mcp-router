# Core Directory

This directory contains the core Python modules for the MCP Router project.

## Contents

- **cognitive/**: Cognitive architecture components for AI agents
- **agents/**: Agent implementations and patterns
- **__init__.py**: Package initialization file

## Purpose

The core modules provide the fundamental building blocks for:
- AI agent architecture and patterns
- Cognitive processing capabilities
- Agent orchestration and coordination
- Decision-making frameworks
- Context management
- Pattern recognition

## Architecture

The core is designed with a layered architecture:
- Base abstractions and interfaces
- Implementation classes
- Utility functions and helpers
- Extension points for custom behaviors

## Integration

These core components are used by:
- The MCP Router for intelligent routing decisions
- The backend services for advanced processing
- The monitoring system for pattern recognition
- The workflow engine for orchestrating agent interactions

## Development

When extending the core functionality:
1. Follow the established patterns and interfaces
2. Add comprehensive tests for new components
3. Document the purpose and usage of new modules
4. Maintain backward compatibility when possible
5. Consider performance implications for AI workloads
